# EEE4518 Group Project - Ping Pong Ball Launcher

## Overview
This project is part of the **EEE4518 Group Project** and is a **ping pong ball launcher** that uses **OpenCV and MediaPipe** for **human pose detection** and controls a **servo motor via Arduino**. The system detects a player's waist position and adjusts the shooting direction accordingly, adding randomness for a more dynamic challenge.

## Features
- **Real-time player detection** using **MediaPipe Pose**.
- **Dynamically adjusts launch direction** based on player position.
- **Servo-controlled aiming mechanism**.
- **Randomized shooting variations** to keep the game interesting.
- **Serial communication** with Arduino to control the servo and launcher.
- **Cooldown and delay logic** for stable movement.

## Dependencies
### **Python Packages**
- `opencv-python` - For handling video input and visualization.
- `mediapipe` - For pose detection.
- `pyserial` - To communicate with Arduino via serial.
